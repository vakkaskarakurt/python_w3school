"""Python Membership Operators
Membership operators are used to test if a sequence is presented in an object:"""

"""IN"""
#Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is present in the object

x = ["apple", "banana"]

print("banana" in x)
# returns True because a sequence with the value "banana" is in the list

"""NOT IN"""
#Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is not present in the object

x = ["apple", "banana"]
print("pineapple" not in x)

# Returns True because a sequence with the value "pineapkke" is not in the list
