x = "Python is awesome"
print(x)

# In the print() function, you output multiple variables, seperated by a comma:
x = "Python"
y = "is"
z = "awesome"
print(x, y, z)

# You can also use the '+' operator to output multiple variables:
x = "Python "
y = "is "
z = "awesome"
print(x+y+z)
# Notice the space character after "Python " and "is ", without them the result would be "Pythonisawesome".

# For numbers, the + character works as a mathematical operator:
x = 5
y= 10
print(x + y)

# # In the print() function, when you try to combine a string and a number with the + operator, Python will give you an error:

# x = 5 
# y = "John"

# print( x + y)

x = 5
y = "John"
print(x, y)
